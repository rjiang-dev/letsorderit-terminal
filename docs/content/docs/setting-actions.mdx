import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';
import { EllipsisVertical, Wrench } from 'lucide-react';

Setting actions are accessible on the default app settings list page by clicking
the <span className="inline-flex">(<EllipsisVertical />)</span> icon.

## 1. Backups & Restore

When selecting `Export`, a dialog will appear showing all user settings encoded
as either `Base64` or raw `JSON`. You can either copy the text in your desired
format or save it to a file on your device.

To import your user settings, simply paste the copied text into the `Import`
input field (or load from a file) under the same format you exported with.

## 2. Device Settings

Clicking the `Settings` entry here will open your device's settings
application.

Additionally, there is a `Launcher` entry that takes you directly to the
"Default Home App" device settings page, which will allow you to select your
desired launcher, e.g.

- {APP_NAME}
- One UI Home
- Nova Launcher
- Pixel Launcher

## 3. Help

This will open the {APP_NAME} Home Page in your default browser:

- https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk

## 4. More

This will open the `More Actions` screen.
