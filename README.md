LetsOrderIt Terminal is a free and open-source Android application for secure,
kiosk-style web browsing.

This repository was forked from the original Webview Kiosk Project:

- https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk

It can function as digital signage, a kid-friendly restricted browser, an
immersive web reader, an interactive signup form, a home assistant dashboard,
or simply a wall clock.

Designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for a simple
and standalone Kiosk solution.

## Key Features

### Core / Standalone

- <b>Lock Task Mode (Pin):</b> prevent access to your device's home screen, apps and status bar
- <b>Secure Settings:</b> configurations are protected by biometrics, device credentials or custom password
- <b>URL Filtering:</b> use regular expressions to control web access through a URL blacklist and whitelist
- <b>Export/Import:</b> backup and restore user settings in Base64 or JSON format
- <b>Local files:</b> display an image, audio, video, or HTML file in kiosk mode from your device
- <b>Default Launcher:</b> use as the home app and launch other apps in lock task mode (kiosk)

### Remote Management / Enterprise

- <b>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)</b>
  - Monitor events, update settings, execute commands and build custom
    automations using the API
  - Requires an MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto, EMQX or HiveMQ)
- <b>Managed Configurations (App Restrictions)</b>
  - For fully-managed (company-owned) devices, settings can be remotely
    configured via an MDM/EMM provider
  - Advanced users using a device policy controller (e.g. Test DPC or OwnDroid)
    can also enforce configurations locally
